## 2022-11-02
## new portfolio planning

### BEFORE BUILDING
* audience
* personal goal: make money? gain experience?
* get a job
* gain experience
* give yourself deadlines
* mvp features: get things started
* back log: ideas for long term

### WHILE BUILDING
focus on one thing at a time
track things e.g. with github projects or trello
collaborate open source, discord, etc.
consider using a tutorial
consider tweaking the tutorial. e.g. from todo app to your own grocery app
make a design. can be a rough sketch with pen and paper. no need to be fancy. then lay out in figma or sketch.
can bring in a designer.
ship it. get feed back. revisit backlog. do the backlog features make sense? if so, are they prioritized above the new features people are requesting? that's if you're building something for others and not just yourself.
